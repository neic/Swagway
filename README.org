** Electronics
The electronics is build around an Arduino. It gets it input from a ADXL345 accelerometer and a ITG-3200 gyro and drives the motors through two HEXFET bridges.

The schematic and board layouts are in Electronics/

** Software
The software for the Arduino onboard the Swagway is located in Software/swagway/

A Processing application with a rolling graph for debugging the angles is located in Software/graph/

** Rapport
A rapport (in danish) on the complete build process will be located in Rapport/
